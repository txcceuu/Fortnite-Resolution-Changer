## 🚀 Why Use This?

Manually changing Fortnite's resolution requires navigating to a config file buried deep in the file system and editing multiple settings.
This tool automates that process with a simple GUI:

* 🔎 Automatically locates your `GameUserSettings.ini`
* 📝 Edits all resolution-related fields correctly
* 🧼 Sets the fullscreen mode to ensure changes apply properly
* ✅ No technical knowledge required
